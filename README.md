This repo is a basic approach to building a memory manager for any application. A memory manager is needed and provides a few ways in which you can write customized memory managers for an application, catering to its specific needs.

There are two memory manager programs here:

1. Bitmapped Memory Manager and
2. Free-lists Based Memory Manager

No one manager is better than the other however, it all depends on your preference. The code for both are here but are in need of some maintenance, 
so feel free to clone this repo and se see if you can figure it out. The code blueprint there it just need some TLC
